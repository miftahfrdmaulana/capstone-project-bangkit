## Garden Guard : An app to Recognize Diseases on Fruit and Vegetable Leaves
### About
The Garden Guard app was developed with the belief that technology has the power to empower individuals to improve agricultural practices. We believe that by providing wider access to plant disease identification tools, this application can help farmers in early disease detection, ultimately enabling timely intervention. This is expected to reduce crop losses caused by plant diseases. Apart from that, this application also aims to support food security by ensuring that agricultural products remain of high quality and quantity is maintained. In this way, Garden Guard strives to create a more sustainable and productive agriculture for all parties involved.
